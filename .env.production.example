# ===================================================================
# ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION - PRODUCTION
# ===================================================================
# These variables must be set in your production environment
# For Vercel: Set these in Project Settings > Environment Variables
#
# ⚠️  CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
# - ALL values are REQUIRED in production
# - NEVER use default or example values
# - Application will REFUSE to start without proper configuration
# - Generate strong secrets using cryptographically secure methods
# ===================================================================

# Application URL - REQUIRED
# Must be your actual production domain (e.g., https://prettysnail.com)
# ⚠️  Cannot be localhost in production
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Database URL - REQUIRED
# PostgreSQL connection string from your hosting provider
# For Vercel Postgres: Get from Vercel Dashboard > Storage > Postgres > .env.local tab
# Format: postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require
# ⚠️  CRITICAL: This contains sensitive database credentials
DATABASE_URL=

# JWT Secret - REQUIRED
# Used for signing authentication tokens
# ⚠️  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
# - MUST be at least 32 characters long
# - MUST be cryptographically random
# - NEVER reuse across environments
# - Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
# Example output: aB3dE5fG7hI9jK1lM3nO5pQ7rS9tU1vW3xY5zA7bC9dE=
JWT_SECRET=

# Admin Credentials - REQUIRED
# Used to create the initial admin account on first deployment
# ⚠️  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
# - Username: Must NOT be "admin" (too common/guessable)
# - Password: Minimum 8 characters, recommended 16+ characters
# - Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
# - Store these credentials securely (password manager)
#
# After first login, you should:
# 1. Login with these credentials
# 2. Immediately change the password through the admin panel (if available)
# 3. Consider enabling 2FA when implemented
ADMIN_USERNAME=
ADMIN_PASSWORD=

# ===================================================================
# DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
# ===================================================================
# Before deploying to production, ensure:
# ✓ All values above are filled in
# ✓ JWT_SECRET is at least 32 characters and cryptographically random
# ✓ ADMIN_USERNAME is NOT "admin"
# ✓ ADMIN_PASSWORD is strong (16+ chars recommended)
# ✓ NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL points to your actual domain
# ✓ DATABASE_URL is correct and tested
# ✓ These values are set as environment variables in Vercel
# ✓ This file is NOT deployed (it's just a reference)
