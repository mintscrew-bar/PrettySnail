# ===================================================================
# ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION - PRODUCTION
# ===================================================================
# These variables must be set in your production environment
# For Vercel: Set these in Project Settings > Environment Variables
#
# ⚠️  CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
# - ALL values are REQUIRED in production
# - NEVER use default or example values
# - Application will REFUSE to start without proper configuration
# - Generate strong secrets using cryptographically secure methods
# ===================================================================

# APPLICATION SETTINGS
# ===================================================================
# Production domain URL
# REQUIRED: Your actual domain (NOT localhost, NOT IP address)
# - Must use HTTPS in production (enforced by security headers)
# - Used for: redirects, Open Graph meta tags, email links
# - Example: https://prettysnail.com
#
# ⚠️  Security: Must match Vercel project domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com

# DATABASE CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================
# PostgreSQL connection string for production database
# REQUIRED: Application will not start without this
#
# ⚠️  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
# - MUST use SSL/TLS (sslmode=require)
# - MUST NOT be a development database
# - MUST have automatic backups enabled
# - Credentials must be randomly generated
#
# Setup for Vercel Postgres:
#   1. Go to Vercel Dashboard > Storage > Create Database > Postgres
#   2. Connect to your project
#   3. Copy the "Secure Prisma URL" from the .env.local tab
#   4. Example: postgresql://user:password@host.postgres.vercel.sh:5432/dbname?sslmode=require
#
# Setup for other PostgreSQL providers:
#   1. Create a database with automatic backups
#   2. Enable SSL/TLS connections
#   3. Format: postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require
#
# ⚠️  CRITICAL: This contains sensitive credentials - never expose in logs
DATABASE_URL=

# AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY
# ===================================================================
# JWT Secret for authentication token signing
# REQUIRED: Application will not start without this
#
# ⚠️  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
# - MUST be at least 32 characters long (64+ recommended)
# - MUST be cryptographically random
# - MUST be unique to this environment (never reuse from dev/staging)
# - MUST be stored in a secure vault or Vercel environment variables
# - Change immediately if compromised
#
# Generate a secure secret:
#   On Windows (PowerShell):
#   [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator]::GetBytes(32))
#   On macOS/Linux:
#   openssl rand -base64 32
#
# Token details:
#   - Algorithm: HS256 (HMAC SHA-256)
#   - Expiration: 7 days
#   - Refresh: Not implemented (re-login required)
#
# ⚠️  Security: Store this value ONLY in Vercel environment variables
JWT_SECRET=

# ADMIN CREDENTIALS
# ===================================================================
# Initial admin account for first deployment
# REQUIRED: Used only during first database initialization
#
# ⚠️  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
# - Username: MUST NOT be "admin", "administrator", or similar
#   * Use a unique, non-obvious name
#   * Recommended: FirstName_LastInitial or similar pattern
# - Password: MUST be strong (16+ characters minimum)
#   * Include: uppercase letters (A-Z)
#   * Include: lowercase letters (a-z)
#   * Include: numbers (0-9)
#   * Include: special characters (!@#$%^&*)
#   * Avoid: dictionary words, keyboard patterns (qwerty), sequential (12345)
#   * Never use the same password as other accounts
#
# Example secure password: Tr0pic@lSnail2024!Secure
#
# POST-DEPLOYMENT ACTIONS:
#   1. Log in with these credentials
#   2. Navigate to /admin/settings
#   3. Change password immediately
#   4. Update username if desired
#   5. Consider creating additional admin accounts with different names
#
# ⚠️  Security: Store these values ONLY in Vercel environment variables or secure vault
ADMIN_USERNAME=
ADMIN_PASSWORD=

# ===================================================================
# DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
# ===================================================================
# Before deploying to production, ensure:
# ✓ All values above are filled in
# ✓ JWT_SECRET is at least 32 characters and cryptographically random
# ✓ ADMIN_USERNAME is NOT "admin"
# ✓ ADMIN_PASSWORD is strong (16+ chars recommended)
# ✓ NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL points to your actual domain
# ✓ DATABASE_URL is correct and tested
# ✓ These values are set as environment variables in Vercel
# ✓ This file is NOT deployed (it's just a reference)
